# dog_game
 Small project with an Arduino to create a small indie game of a dog running and avoiding fences or birds. 
 
 The dog has two lives (hearts) and once it reaches zero, the player can play again or choose to end, following an "Game Over" screen. 
 
 Bird's speed is random and, every time a bird passes, the display toggles between the score and the hearts.
